    &quot;content&quot;: {
      &quot;explanatory_section&quot;: &quot;Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human language. These models, like GPT-3, are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to predict and generate text based on input prompts. LLMs are used in various applications such as chatbots, text generation, and language translation.&quot;,
      &quot;example&quot;: &quot;Consider a chatbot that uses an LLM to answer customer inquiries. When a customer types, &#x27;What are your store hours?&#x27;, the model generates a text response based on its training data, providing the correct hours.&quot;,
      &quot;practice_question&quot;: &quot;What is one real-world application of LLMs, and how do they enhance this application?&quot;
    }
  },
  &quot;2&quot;: {
    &quot;content&quot;: {
      &quot;explanatory_section&quot;: &quot;Prompting is the method of interacting with LLMs by providing them with initial text (prompts) to generate desired responses. The quality and clarity of prompts significantly influence the output. Effective prompting can steer the model toward generating relevant and accurate responses.&quot;,
      &quot;example&quot;: &quot;If you prompt an LLM with &#x27;Write a poem about the sea,&#x27; it may produce a poetic text that describes the sea&#x27;s beauty and mysteries.&quot;,
      &quot;practice_question&quot;: &quot;Try prompting an LLM with &#x27;Explain the importance of recycling.&#x27; What kind of response do you receive?&quot;
    }
  },
  &quot;3&quot;: {
    &quot;content&quot;: {
      &quot;explanatory_section&quot;: &quot;This module guides you through practical experience with LLMs, such as using GPT. You&#x27;ll learn how to write simple prompts and evaluate the responses generated by the model. This hands-on practice strengthens your understanding of how LLMs process inputs.&quot;,
      &quot;example&quot;: &quot;Using a platform like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT, enter the prompt &#x27;Tell me a fun fact about space.&#x27; Analyze the response for accuracy and creativity.&quot;,
      &quot;practice_question&quot;: &quot;Write a prompt to learn about the benefits of exercise and evaluate the model&#x27;s response for completeness and relevance.&quot;
    }
  },
  &quot;4&quot;: {
    &quot;content&quot;: {
      &quot;explanatory_section&quot;: &quot;Ethical considerations in LLM usage involve understanding the potential impacts on society, such as bias in responses, misinformation, and privacy concerns. Responsible AI practices include transparency, fairness, and accountability in deploying these models.&quot;,
      &quot;example&quot;: &quot;An ethical issue might arise if an LLM generates biased text based on skewed training data. Ensuring diverse and balanced training data can mitigate this risk.&quot;,
      &quot;practice_question&quot;: &quot;Discuss a potential ethical issue when using LLMs in social media platforms.&quot;
    }
  },
  &quot;5&quot;: {
    &quot;content&quot;: {
      &quot;explanatory_section&quot;: &quot;To further your understanding of LLMs and AI, explore resources like academic articles, online courses, and AI communities. Continuous learning helps keep pace with advancements and innovations in the field.&quot;,
      &quot;example&quot;: &quot;Coursera offers courses on AI and machine learning that can provide deeper insights into how LLMs work and their applications.&quot;,
      &quot;practice_question&quot;: &quot;Identify one online resource or course that you could use to learn more about AI and briefly describe its content.&quot;
